## üìù Notes / Assumptions
- **API Key Security:** The OpenWeatherMap API key is required. For public deployments, consider using a Next.js API route as a proxy for better security, even though the key is not highly sensitive.
- **Design Decisions:**
  - Zustand is used for simple, global state management (search history, units, etc.)
  - SWR is used for efficient data fetching and caching.
  - All weather icons use Next.js `<Image />` for optimization.
  - The UI is built with accessibility and keyboard navigation in mind.
  - Animations and transitions are handled via Tailwind CSS for a smooth user experience.
- **Error Handling:** The app displays user-friendly error messages and only shows errors after a search is performed.
- **Responsiveness:** The layout adapts to all device sizes, with dark mode support.
